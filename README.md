Overview

The project involves creating a system to manage and analyze product transactions through a set of APIs and a frontend application. The APIs support listing transactions with search and pagination, retrieving monthly statistics, and generating data for bar and pie charts. The frontend will display transaction data in a table with month selection, search, and pagination capabilities, and visualize sales data through charts. This setup aims to provide comprehensive transaction management and insightful data analysis for users.
